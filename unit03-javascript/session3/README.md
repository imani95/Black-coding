# Javascript Session 3 starter files

Starter files:

- `index.html`
- `index.js`

The `index.js` is already be connected to the `index.html` on `line 15`. All you need to do is write your Javascript code in the `index.js` file and open the `index.html` in a browser.

Everytime you make a change in the `index.js` (and it's been saved) all you will need to do is refresh the `index.html` in the browser and you will see your changes come through.

## While/For loop tasks

Inside the `index.js` there is a `randomNumber` that can be used inside your `while` and `for` loops to generate a random number to be used in the tasks.

## Loops and Array Methods final task

Inside the `index.js` you will find an array of objects called `people` and a helper function called `compare`. Both of these are there to help you with the final task of the session.
